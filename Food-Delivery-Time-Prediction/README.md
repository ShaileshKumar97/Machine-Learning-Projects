# Food Delivery Time Prediction

Predicting the delivery time of your order is a challenging task for every food delivery service like Zomato and Swiggy.

One of the best strategies to predict the delivery time is by calculating the distance between the point of picking up the order and the point of delivering the order. And then predicting the delivery time based on how much time your delivery partners took to deliver orders in the past for the same distance.
